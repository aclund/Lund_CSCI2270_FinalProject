# Lund_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:
My project is an extension on Assignment 5 that focused on queues. 
In addition to the dequeue, enqueue, and print operations, I added 
a queue size input, an alphebetizier for alphebetical and reverse 
alphebetical order, a dequeue operation for specific inputed 
words, a head modifier, and a clear option.

How to Run:
First you have to set the queue size that you wish to work with. 
Then the main menu is displayed. The user has to then enqueue 
something into the queue by selecting one of the enqueue 
operations otherwise the queue will be empty. The main menu will
continue to pop up until the user selects the quit option.

Dependencies:
No dependencies other than user input.

System Requirements:
The project will run on any operating system.

Group Members/Contributers:
None

Open Issues/bugs:
Fully funcional.
